# Lessons Learned

Please contribute to lessons learned. These are simply mine, dropped here in a
first pass attempt to openly and visibly iterate on the team leadership experience
for Cloud Foundry.

## Backlog Management
Backlog management is predominately dictated by the relationship between you,
your product manager, and the team. I've had success with having an icebox of
tech debt cleanup chores and tasks that don't directly add consumer value, then
after an IPM, prioritizing those chores into the backlog in a way that
distributes [toil][toil-SRE] and grunge work, without exhausting the engineering
team. Consider an "open-icebox" approach, where any team member can drop a chore
in the icebox, and your job becomes prioritization of pain points, instead of
being directly responsible for seeing all the pain points.

## Team Health

### Feedback
Use feedback to find out what **your** team needs. This [pivotalk
article][amelia-pivotalk] outlined one anchor's approach to anonymous feedback
on the anchor.

## Managing Technical Debt 
If you ever personally feel pain around toil,
manual, or grunge work you are doing, this is a sign that you should be
investing in chipping away at tech debt. I think one of the best things an
anchor can do for tech debt is faciliate an environment in which people don't
want to deal with it anymore, and the response to that can be filing an issue,
writing a chore, etc. As long as the team has a process for whittling it down,
use that process.
